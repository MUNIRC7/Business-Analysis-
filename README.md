Forecasting and Simulation Modelling Project

University of Westminster, School of Computer Science and Engineering
Module: Business Analytics

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of forecasting and simulation techniques in solving real-world problems. The coursework is divided into two main parts: Forecasting and Simulation, each addressing specific challenges within their respective domains.

Part A: Forecasting Video Game Sales
The first part of the project focuses on forecasting global sales of video games using historical data from 1997 to 2011. The dataset includes global sales and average reviews per genre (Action, Adventure, and Shooter). Key tasks include:

Time Series Analysis: Plotting yearly global sales per genre and analyzing time series characteristics.
Forecasting Models: Applying various forecasting techniques including Na√Øve method, Moving Average, and Exponential Smoothing.

Model Recommendation: Comparing accuracy of different models and recommending the best approach.
Regression Analysis: Exploring the relationship between average review scores and global sales using least squares method.

Part B: Simulation Modelling for EasyB&B.com
The second part involves simulating the operations of a customer service system for EasyB&B.com, a start-up providing a network for bed and breakfasts in the UK. Key tasks include:

Random Number Generation: Simulating time between customer calls using a discrete probability distribution.
Scenario Analysis: Evaluating different customer service scenarios with one and two representatives to determine optimal staffing levels.
Performance Metrics: Calculating key statistics such as waiting times and total time spent in the system to recommend the best staffing plan.

Deliverables
Report: A detailed PDF or Word document containing all answers, formulas, graphs, and discussion.
Supporting Documents: A zipped folder with Excel or R files providing evidence of the work done.

Tools Used
xcel for data analysis and simulation.
Learning Outcomes
This project assesses the ability to model and solve problems using forecasting and simulation techniques, analyze results, and discuss solutions. It also emphasizes professional report presentation and adherence to academic integrity.

Usage
To run the analysis and simulations, you can use the provided Excel or R scripts included in the repository. Detailed instructions and explanations are provided in the report document.

The video games file is an excel file that is zipped download and upload to excel to be able to view it.
